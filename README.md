# Biosphere-resereves-data
This repository provides access to data of forest spatial changes of 19 Mesoamerican biosphere reserves, the code to calculate diversity of non-farm- labor, and a diagram of the workflow of the data processing and data analysis to accomplish our study.

The data is part of a submited paper (not yet published):
